How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It reduced the amount of code i had to look through to find the bug.
	By only showing the lines that had change from version to version.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    By giving you a point to go back to befor the changes, saving you the time of changeing back. 

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    The pros are that you can enter the commit at a logical time.
	The cons are that it is relying on user to make the commit.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    This is because git is desinged as a tool for prgrammers first and is buld to work with repositorys

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    useing the command git log lets you see all the version and there comments and 
	the git diff command will show you the difference between versions.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    By giving me the ability to quickly change back to a previouse version of the code.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I want to use it for versioning my code
